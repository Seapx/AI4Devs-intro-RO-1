# Reverse string - base

I need a small project with an HTML file and a JS script. It should consist of a page with a text input and a button.
When the button is clicked, it should read the content of the input and display the same text reversed next to it â€” for
example, "Samir" would return "rimaS".

# Reverse string - optional 1

Now I need the button to reverse the text to only appear if the input text has more than three letters.

# Reverse string - optional 2

Lastly, I need one more change: the reversed text should be displayed in real time, and the button should no longer be
necessary.

Let's remove the restriction that the input must be longer than three characters.
